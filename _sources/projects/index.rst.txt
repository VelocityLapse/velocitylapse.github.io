Velocity Lapse has the concept of Projects. A Project contains the images and settings that make up your time-lapse which are saved to your storage until you delete the Project. 

Projects offer you the flexibility to delete individual images and export your time-lapse multiple times in different formats and with different settings. You can even capture more images or import photos from your gallery to add to your time-lapse if you so choose!
