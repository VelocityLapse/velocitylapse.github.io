Velocity Lapse can create a new Timelapse project from imported images. 

.. note::
    The PRO version allows you to import more than 400 images at one time.

Import Tab
----------

To import images from your gallery as a new project, navigate to the Import tab on the home screen and tap one of the buttons to select either a folder of images or individual images.

Select Folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose a folder on your device or SD card to import as a new Timelapse project.

Select Images
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Choose individual images from your photo gallery to import as a new Timelapse project. Please note that the Android image picker is not meant for thousands of images and it will crash if you try.  Instead, to import large amounts of images, please use the :guilabel:`Select Folder` button.

---

.. note::
    You must select at least 2 images and have enough storage in order to import.

Once imported, you can delete frames and export to video or image sequence like a normal Timelapse project.
