The settings screen allows you to change global and specific options for how the app behaves and more. 

Settings
--------

From top to bottom:

Share Feedback Or Suggestion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Help make Velocity Lapse better by share your feedback and comments with me (the developer).

Filename Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The format used for naming the captured image files. Unless you have a specific reason to change this, in most cases you will want to leave it set to Frame Number and Timestamp (the default).

Default Capture Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default capture resolution that should be set when creating a new Timelapse or Photolapse mode project. This saves the time and hassle of setting the resolution for each new project, especially if you always shoot in 4K, for example.

Default Capture Time Delay
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default capture time delay that should be set when creating a new Timelapse project.

Flashlight Auto Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the flashlight is enabled in Timelapse mode, the flashlight will automatically turn on and off. 

.. note::
    This only applies when the interval is set to 2 seconds or longer. If this setting is disabled, when the flashlight is enabled it will stay on for the entire length of the capture.

Keep Screen Awake
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With this setting enabled, the app will prevent the screen from automatically turning off during Timelapse captures.

.. note::
    This uses Android wake lock, so it does have the potential to drain the device battery faster.

Ask For A Project Name
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If enabled, when creating a new project you will be prompted to set the project name.

Show project presets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If enabled, when creating a new project the project preset options that are supported by your device will be displayed.

Apply Timestamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Apply a date/time stamp to all images captured in Timelapse and Photolapse mode. 

.. note:: 
    This is a global setting, so after this is enabled **all future captured images will have a timestamp applied**. A preview of the timestamp is shown in Timelapse mode to help you to remember when this setting is enabled.

Timestamp Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The date/time format used for the timestamp text.

Timestamp Position
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The position of where the timestamp will be place on the capture image.

Timestamp Size
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The size of the timestamp text.

Timestamp Color
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The color of the timestamp text.

Timestamp Shadow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When this is enabled, a shadow will be applied behind the timestamp text.

Default Framerate
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The frame rate used to calculate output video duration, etc in Timelapse mode. This will also be used as the default frame rate for export to video (if possible).

Video Codec
^^^^^^^^^^^

The video codec to use when encoding exported videos.

Velocity Lapse gives you three popular options:

- :guilabel:`AVC (H.264)` - the most widely used and supported video codec today.
- :guilabel:`HEVC (H.265)` - meant to be the successor to AVC, offering up to 50% better compression and thus smaller video file sizes. This option is dependent on device support.
- :guilabel:`AV1 (AOMedia Video 1)` - a newer, open-source codec which offers even better compression while retaining quality. This option is only available on Android 14+.

.. note::
    ``HEVC (H.265)`` video is not as widely supported across devices and PCs as ``AVC (H.264)`` encoded video and the ``AV1 (AOMedia Video 1)`` option **does not currently support 4K and 8K video**. Therefore, at this time it is generally recommended that unless you have a specific reason to do otherwise, to stick with ``AVC (H.264)`` (the default).

Video Export Save Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The location where videos that are exported from Velocity Lapse will be saved to. Due to Android storage limitations, only the ``/Pictures``, ``/DCIM``, ``/Movies``, or ``/Documents`` folders are supported. 

.. note::
    On Android 9 and prior, setting to the SD card is unsupported.

Image Export Save Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The location where image sequences that are exported from Velocity Lapse will be saved to. Due to Android storage limitations, only the ``/Pictures``, ``/DCIM``, ``/Movies``, or ``/Documents`` folders are supported. 

.. note::
    On Android 9 and prior, setting to the SD card is unsupported.

Keep Image Aspect Ratio
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During export to video, keep the original image aspect ratio rather than cropping to fill the selected video export resolution.

Language
^^^^^^^^

Change the interface language.
