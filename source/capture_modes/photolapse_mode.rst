Photolapse Mode
###############

Photolapse Mode allows you to create time-lapses, hyper-lapses, or stop-motion animations by capturing individual photos over an extended period of time without having to leave your device on location. At a time you decide, line up the last image with the previous photo, capture a photo, and repeat. 

Photolapse Mode is great for capturing time-lapses of long events like construction projects or plant growth that can last over weeks, months, or even years.


Bottom Bar
----------

In Photolapse mode, at the bottom of the screen (or at the side of the screen when in landscape orientation) is the bottom bar. From left to right:

Previous Frames
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tap to open the current project in the Editor screen. A thumbnail of the last captured photo and the total number of photos in the Photolapse project is displayed.

Capture Resolution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change the resolution of the captured photos from preset options. If the selected resolution preset is not available on the device, it will automatically drop down to the closest supported resolution. Max available resolution looks for the highest supported resolution available to third-party devices.

Capture Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Capture a photo.

Camera Settings Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Opens the Camera Settings.

Photolapse Settings Button
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Opens the Photolapse Settings.


Camera Settings
---------------

Starting from the top left to right:

Zoom
^^^^

Control the current camera zoom.

Available Lenses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The available lenses for the current camera direction are displayed. Tapping on a lens will switch the current camera preview to that lens. 

.. note::
    If only one lens is displayed, your device may not support other lenses or the device does not give access to other lenses to third-party apps through the standard camera API.

Flip Camera Direction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Flip the direction of the current camera, from back to front or front to back.

Exposure Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The EV (exposure value) slider adjusts the camera auto exposure, making the image brighter or darker.

Focus
^^^^^

Set the camera focus distance manually. A lower focus distance value will focus on close objects (the foreground) and blur the background. Setting a higher focus distance value will focus on objects far away and blur any objects close to the lens.

Photolapse Settings
-------------------

Starting from the top left to right:

Camera Grid Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Switch between 4 different camera grid styles, or turn the grid off.

Camera Marker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Toggle displaying a movable marker that will persist in the same spot each time you open the camera to capture a photo. Simply tap and drag to set the marker position. 

.. hint::
    The marker is especially useful for keeping track of a specific point in view when creating hyper-lapses.

Overlay Opacity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Change the opacity of the previous photo that is placed over the camera preview.


Bluetooth/Volume Button Capture
