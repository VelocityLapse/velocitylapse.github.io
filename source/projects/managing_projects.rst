Managing Projects
#################

On the home screen, both Timelapse mode and Photolapse mode have a similar interface for managing projects.

You can switch between Timelapse and Photolapse projects by tapping the tabs at the bottom of the home screen.

Each project is shown with a thumbnail of the most recent image, the name of the project, the date the project was last edited, the number of images (called "frames") in the project, and the image resolution.

There are also icons displayed to indicate whether the project was created from imported images or if the project has been exported to video or an image sequence. These indicators are useful for determining whether you've saved your time-lapse elsewhere so it is safe for you to delete the project.

- The file up icon indicates that the project was created by importing images.
- The single check-mark icon indicates that the project has been exported to either video OR an image sequence.
- The double check-mark icon indicates that the project has been exported to both video AND an image sequence.


Creating Projects
-----------------

For both Timelapse and Photolapse mode, you can create a new project by tapping on the large, blue :guilabel:`New Timelapse` or :guilabel:`New Photolapse` buttons, respectively.

If the :guilabel:`Ask for a project name` setting is enabled in settings, you will be prompted to give a name when creating new projects. Otherwise, a default project name will be set.

Project Preset options will be displayed if the :guilabel:`Show project presets` setting is enabled.


Deleting and Renaming Projects
------------------------------

Tapping on the three dots button brings up a menu to rename the project or delete the project and images permanently.


Sorting Projects
----------------

You can sort the displayed ordering of the projects by tapping the sort button and choosing the sorting you prefer.
