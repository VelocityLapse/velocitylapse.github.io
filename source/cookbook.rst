Recipes of specific how-tos using Velocity Lapse to capture different time-lapse subjects.


Astrophotography
----------------

Velocity Lapse has many features enabling the creation of astro time-lapses on supported devices.

Capturing
^^^^^^^^^

The most important settings for capturing astro images are :guilabel:`shutter speed` and :guilabel:`ISO`. 

*The shutter speed and ISO ranges in Velocity Lapse depend on what your device allows third-party apps like Velocity Lapse to access. For shutter speed, this is unfortunately often much less than what the stock camera app can access.*

Generally, you can capture the brightest stars in the sky with a shutter speed of even just 1 second, but a shutter speed of 6, 8, 10, or even 30 seconds will produce much better and impressive images.

ISO brightens your image at the cost of more noise (or grain).

Focus should be set to manual and infinity.

Ideally, you want to find a place away from cities and artificial lighting where you can avoid light pollution as doing so will enable you to capture more of the night sky.

Experimentation is key!


The Night Sky
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can find an informative video tutorial showing how you can create a time-lapse of the starry night sky using Velocity Lapse `here <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uySrvCVA-Us>`_. *(The video is from 2022, so the app interface is different but the concepts remain the same).*


Star Trails
^^^^^^^^^^^

Velocity Lapse has the ability to create star trail time-lapses.
